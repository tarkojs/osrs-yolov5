# OSRS-YOLOv5

This is a hobby project that utilizes the YOLOv5 object detection model to automate various in-game activities in Old School Runescape (OSRS) by detecting and interacting with on-screen objects. The scripts automate activities such as woodcutting, fishing, and operating the blast furnace.

**Note:** As of now, the code is not clean and may very well be incomplete.
