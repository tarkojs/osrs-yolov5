# OSRS-YOLOv5

This is a hobby project that utilizes the YOLOv5 object detection model to automate various in-game activities in Old School Runescape (OSRS) by detecting and interacting with on-screen objects. The scripts automate activities such as woodcutting, fishing, operating the blast furnace, and mining.

**Most scripts are not complete - new models needed**

## Requirements
* PyAutoGUI
* PIL
* PyTorch
* Python 3.x

## Examples

## Usage

The only file you need to interact with is **run.py**, specify the script you want to use and run the Python file.
You may need to specify inventory items' on-screen locations.
